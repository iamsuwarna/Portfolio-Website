                        Huge amounts of information can be gathered and preserved attributable to communications technology. This could be proprietary information about people or companies. It can also be exceedingly tough to maintain the whole systems confidential. A sole cyber attack will lead to significant volumes of personally identifiable information ended up in the hands of terrorists, extremists, firms, global enemies, or even other fraudsters.

                    By its multinational existence, size, and complete confidentiality that people will obtain, the internet is fertile soil for villainous entities to act. Terrorists utilizing social networking sites to endorse itself and inspire everyone else; human traffickers trafficking on the deep web; homosexuals grooming potential victims, exchanging pictures, images, and other material in chat rooms and other places; and authoritarian governments trying to sway or distort votes in modern democracies are just a few instances.

                    Personal privacy has become much more difficult to maintain in the modern world, on top of the risks of your personal data being hacked or traded. For example, anybody with a smartphone can take photographs and video recordings and upload it to the internet. Employers can look up candidates online and discover unflattering photos of them, as well as see them share negative views on social media or websites. In public spaces, digital cameras track and document our activities. When minor transgressions are exposed on the internet, they will follow a person for the rest of their lives. It's tough, if not impossible, to keep track of your personal records.
